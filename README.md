🎭 Spot Imposter – Web Safety Chat Game for Teens

Spot Imposter is an educational web-based game designed to teach teenagers how to recognize unsafe and manipulative behavior in online conversations.

The game simulates a realistic group chat where multiple participants discuss a common topic. One participant is secretly assigned as the Imposter and is instructed to subtly use harmful or problematic online phrases (such as social pressure, normalization of harassment, or privacy violations) without getting caught.

The other participants must:

Pay attention to the conversation

Identify suspicious messages

Detect who the Imposter is before time runs out

After the chat phase, players vote on:

Who they believe the Imposter is

Which messages contained harmful or unsafe tactics

The goal is to promote digital awareness, critical thinking, and online safety through interactive gameplay rather than lectures.
